	DESCRIPTION
****************************

 AspNetEdit is an Add-in for MonoDevelop. It adds the functionality for 
developing ASP.NET WebForms in WYSIWYG fashion. The visual editor is based on
the WebKit rendering engine and it's C#-wrapper - WebKit#.


	CONTENTS
****************************
 What can you expect in the different folders:
* AspNetEdit.Editor/ - The editor host and other classes that binds the editor 
together
* AspNetEdit.Editor.ComponentModel/ - Implementation of the
System.ComponentModel.Design architecture
* AspNetEdit.Editor.DesignerLink/ - The C#/WebKit# glue layer
* AspNetEdit.Editor.UI/ - The visual modules of the editor
* AspNetEdit.Integration/ - Classes that implement different extension points
of MonoDevelop
* AspNetEdit.Tools/ - Collection of classes that are used across the addin
* designer_context/ - The javascript and css files loaded besides the user
document that make the visual representation editable.


	INSTALATION
****************************
 The addin can be build using the MonoDevelops profiles configuration:
1) Create a file in monodevelop/profiles with a name of your choice.

2) Add the following lines to the file:
main
extras/AspNetEdit

3) Run the configure script with the following parameter:
$ ./configure --profile=<the_name_you_gave_to_the_file>

4) If the config passes successfully just run:
$ make
# make run
or
# make install
depending on what you are trying to achieve

5) Create a WebForms project and you should be able to select a tab called 
"Designer" for the .aspx files.


	NOTES
****************************
 The editor is still not ready for general usage, although it works pretty
stable. It can edit/remove controls, but dragging controls from the toolbox
is to be implemented.
