	DESCRIPTION
=================

 AspNetEdit is an Add-in for MonoDevelop. It adds the functionality for 
developing ASP.NET WebForms in WYSIWYG fashion. The visual editor is based on
the WebKit rendering engine and it's C#-wrapper - WebKit#.


	CONTENTS
=================
 What can you expect in the different folders:
* AspNetEdit.Editor/ - The editor host and other classes that binds the editor 
together
* AspNetEdit.Editor.ComponentModel/ - Implementation of the
System.ComponentModel.Design architecture
* AspNetEdit.Editor.DesignerLink/ - The C#/WebKit# glue layer
* AspNetEdit.Editor.UI/ - The visual modules of the editor
* AspNetEdit.Integration/ - Classes that implement different extension points
of MonoDevelop
* AspNetEdit.Tools/ - Collection of classes that are used across the addin
* designer_context/ - The javascript and css files loaded besides the user
document that make the visual representation editable.


	INSTALATION
=================
The addin requires the latest mono build and MonoDevelop build from
17th of March 2013 or newer. The WebKitSharp library is also required.
You can build the addin using MonoDevelop/XamarinStudio and install 
the addin using the Addin manager. You will need to copy the 
designer_context dir to the installation folder of the addin.

	NOTES
=================
 The editor is still not ready for general usage, although it works pretty
stable. It can edit/remove controls, but dragging controls from the toolbox
is to be implemented.
