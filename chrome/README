INSTALLATION
============
The addin has been packaged into a single file, aspdesigner.jar. This must be 
registered as Mozilla chrome in order to get the privileges it requires.

On Firefox 1.5 or Mozilla 1.8 or greater, an aspdesigner.manifest file should 
be placed in $MOZILLA_HOME/chrome/. this should contain lines similar to the 
following:
  content aspdesigner jar:$ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_JAR/aspdesigner.jar!/content/aspdesigner/
  locale aspdesigner en-US jar:$ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_JAR/aspdesigner.jar!/locale/en-US/aspdesigner/
where $ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_JAR is the absolute path of the aspdesigner.jar file.

On Mozilla 1.7 or FF 1.0, .manifest files are not used. Instead, the file
$MOZILLA_HOME/chrome/installed-chrome.txt file must be edited, and the 
following lines added:
  content,install,url,jar:resource:/chrome/aspdesigner.jar!/content/aspdesigner/
  locale,install,url,jar:resource:/chrome/aspdesigner.jar/locale/en-US/aspdesigner/
In addition, the aspdesigner.jar file must be placed in $MOZILLA_HOME/chrome/

Once the chrome has been installed, the extention will be available through the
URL chrome://aspdesigner/content/


NOTES
=====
* The addin has a severe bug when used with Firefox 1.5. For some reason it 
  becomes re-initialised, and this causes the ASP.NET controls to become 
  unselectable. Other editing is still possible.

* The installation instructions for installed-chrome.txt have not been tested.
